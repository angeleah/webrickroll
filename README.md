Webrickroll
===========
A Rails Engine packaged as a gem that will highjack every request and Rickroll you.

When I first started using rails, every time webrick was mentioned or I booted it up, I thought "web rick roll" and dreamed of being able to Rickroll people when they started their server. Finally, here it is.  Although it started with wanting to work with webrick, this gem is server independent. Special thanks to [Doug Bradbury](https://github.com/dougbradbury) for helping me get started and to [Dayton Nolan](https://github.com/daytonn) for his googling skills. Enjoy. I know I will. You've just been Webrickrolled.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
- To use:
  + Add the gem to the Gemfile( gem "webrickroll").
  + Bundle
  + Stop and restart the server
  + Navigate to any route within your app in a browser window.
  + You've just been webrickrolled
  + Simply remove the gem from the Gemfile and re-bundle to remove Rickrolling.

- To use discreetly(say, while your pair is in the restroom in order to surprise them upon return):
  + Add the gem to the Gemfile( gem "webrickroll").
  + Bundle
  + Do this in a separate terminal window and then close it to leave no suspicion.
  + Stop and restart the server
  + Allow your unsuspecting victim to navigate to any route within your app in a browser window. If you are using Safari you are in for a special surprise.
  + Enjoy the video and feel the sweet victory of pulling off a hilarious prank.
  + Simply remove the gem from the Gemfile and re-bundle to remove Rickrolling.
  + Lock your computer the next time you go to the bathroom.
