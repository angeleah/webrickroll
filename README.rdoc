= Webrickroll

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

When I first started using rails, every time webrick was mentioned or I booted it up, I thought "rickroll". Webrickroll.  Finally, here it is.  Special thanks to Doug Bradbury for helping me get started and to Dayton Nolan for his googling skills.  Enjoy.  I know I will.  You've just been Webrickrolled.
